This is my midterm shopping cart React app. 

You need to git clone https://github.com/kiraashley24/inf655_midterm.git in order to access the project. This can be done in your preferred developer.

Type cd into the new folder and type npm install.

To run, type in npm start.

Features:
This project has different components including product, products, cart, search, and checkout.
It has a homepage, products page, and cart page. (with a checkout and thank you page not shown in nav bar)
It displays all of the products (in this case flowers!!), on the products page. It allows users to search for any flower.
In the cart section, all items are displayed with image, name and price. It allows you to add a number of quantity per item. 
You are able to add or remove items from cart.
It then allows you to see the Total Price of the cart.
Finally there is a form for shipping, including name, email, and address. 

I hope you enjoy my project !!
